    <div>
    Hi, I'm Nathan Taylor. I am an aspiring software developer currently looking for work! 
    
    </div><br><div>Besides programming, my background is in Pure Mathematics (two Master's degrees, five years of graduate-level work), in automotive repair (I fix most issues on my own cars; I worked for a Ford dealership last year, and took some classes on diesel truck repair), and basic electronics. </div>
    <br>
    <div>
    I'm looking for a position somewhere in Oregon, ideally in the Corvallis / Salem area. I'm more than happy to talk about opportunities or general networking. Thanks!

    <div>About the name Pecan Pine:</div>
    <div>The name pecan pine comes from "pecan pie"--the Southern dessert, together with pine, i.e. pine tree. The name juxtaposes my Southern heritage (my extended family is from the South) with where I grew up (in the foothills of California, where there are lots of pine trees).</div>

    Hi, I'm Nathan Taylor. I am an aspiring software developer currently looking for work! 
    
    </div><br><div>Besides programming, my background is in Pure Mathematics (two Master's degrees, five years of graduate-level work), in automotive repair (I fix most issues on my own cars; I worked for a Ford dealership last year, and took some classes on diesel truck repair), and basic electronics. </div>
    <br>
    <div>
    I'm looking for a position somewhere in Oregon, ideally in the Corvallis / Salem area. I'm more than happy to talk about opportunities or general networking. Thanks!
